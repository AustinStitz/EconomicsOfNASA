        <p>NASA can either produce satellites or rockets. Rockets use significantly more resources per unit than satellites do, so the maximum output of rockets is less than the maximum output of satellites. Additionally, rockets and satellites mostly use similar resources (metal, computer chips, etc.) but rockets need a greater amount of engines than satellites do in order to reach orbit, and different types of physical capital are used for each too, especially given that larger-scale machinery is needed to produce rockets which are significantly larger than the satellites, so there is some increasing opportunity cost, but this is limited.</p>

        <h3>Supply and Demand</h3>

        <p>NASA purchases launches from SpaceX. Here is the supply and demand curve for SpaceX rockets. The equilibrium price is $62 million and the equilibrium quantity is 30 launches (per year). Now, let's say average income increases and SpaceX invents a new machine to make building rockets easier. Now, the demand and supply will both shift to the right, leaving the price indeterminate and the quantity increasing.</p>

        <p>Let's say now that the government hopes to impose a binding price ceiling on SpaceX at $50 million in order to reduce the cost of access to space. As can be seen in the graph, this creates a shortage due to producers (in this case, SpaceX and its competitors) being willing and able to produce less than consumers are willing and able to purchase. Additionally, fewer mutually beneficial transactions occur, creating deadweight loss.</p>

        <h3>Excise Tax</h3>

        <p>Now, let's say the US government hopes to impose a $10 million excise tax on rocket launches to provide greater government revenues from the wealthiest people in the country. The price elasticities of supply and demand for launch services are difficult to determine, so I'm assuming approximately unit-elastic elasticities. The price elasticity of demand relies primarily on the primary consumers. If the primary consumers were private individuals looking to go to space, demand would be greatly elastic, launch services being a luxury that also takes a considerable portion of the consumer's income. However, if the consumers were mostly government and military organizations, elasticity would be greatly inelastic since it can often even be considered a matter of national security. Additionally, elasticity of supply depends greatly on reusability of spacecraft. A highly reusable spacecraft would have more elastic supply since no additional resources other than fuel would be required. However, a less reusable spacecraft would have inelastic supply due to the immense costs required to create an individual rocket. However, although we could estimate based on the current market for SpaceX rockets what the elasticity would be, small sample sizes make it difficult to statistically determine the elasticities of supply and demand. In this case, since both supply and demand are unit-elastic, the tax is evenly distributed between producers and consumers. However, had demand been more elastic or supply been more inelastic, a greater portion would be laid on producers, and had demand been more inelastic or supply more elastic, a greater portion would be laid on consumers.</p>

        <p>The United States isn't the only country that produces rockets. Many other countries includihng Russia, China, India, New Zealand, and various European countries, also produce rockets. Let's assume the world price for rockets is $40 million (only hypothetical) and a tariff of $10 million per unit were imposed on imports, leaving the tariff price to be $50 million. As the graph shows, there is a deadweight loss due to the increased price leading to fewer mutually beneficial transactions, but the government also gains a revenue from the tariff. As tariffs are intended to protect domestic producers, the producer surplus increases in this case, although consumer surplus dramatically decreases.</p>
