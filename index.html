        <p>NASA can either produce satellites or rockets. Rockets use significantly more resources per unit than satellites do, so the maximum output of rockets is less than the maximum output of satellites. Additionally, rockets and satellites mostly use similar resources (metal, computer chips, etc.) but rockets need a greater amount of engines than satellites do in order to reach orbit, and different types of physical capital are used for each too, especially given that larger-scale machinery is needed to produce rockets which are significantly larger than the satellites, so there is some increasing opportunity cost, but this is limited.</p>

        <p>NASA purchases launches from SpaceX. Here is the supply and demand curve for SpaceX rockets. The equilibrium price is $62 million and the equilibrium quantity is 30 launches (per year). Now, let's say average income increases and SpaceX invents a new machine to make building rockets easier. Now, the demand and supply will both shift to the right, leaving the price indeterminate and the quantity increasing.</p>

        <p>Let's say now that the government hopes to impose a binding price ceiling on SpaceX at $50 million in order to reduce the cost of access to space. As can be seen in the graph, this creates a shortage due to producers (in this case, SpaceX and its competitors) being willing and able to produce less than consumers are willing and able to purchase. Additionally, fewer mutually beneficial transactions occur, creating deadweight loss.</p>
